# Roku Flashback Project

### Take a trip back to yesteryear with your old audio, tv and film faves!

#### Setup
Clone the repo to your localhost location (htdocs, www directory or wherever your local server expects to find your files)
Install the database with the tool of your choice, or drop the crutches and use the command line!
NPM install dependencies, Gulp for basic build and open in your favourite browser! 

Or use IE to download and install something that actually works.

#### Dependencies:
Gulp. That's pretty much it.

And SASS.
So you might need to install SASS for gulp-sass to work.

#### Built with:
Vue (bare bones - no webpack!)

vue-router

Boostrap 4

A little sprinkle of jQuery, because Bootstrap uses it

#### Authors / Dev Team:
TVR and SpiderPan
